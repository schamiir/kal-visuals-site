## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I learned much about  implementing my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the challenges I faced was the projects section and getting BootStrap to properly display the videos in gallery format and animate them. I was able to Google the right questions and found the solution.
